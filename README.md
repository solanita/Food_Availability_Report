# Food_Availability_Report
Analysis of FAOSTAT data to see how much the countries of the world depend on import of food.
The analysis was made as a final project during the Data Analytics Course by CareerFoundry.


## Project overview

### Objectives
The purpose of the project was to determine levels of import dependency and self-sufficiency of world countries when it comes to the food commodities.
### Results
The EDA conducted in Python which included spatial and time analysis, clustering, linear regression, and forecasting showed that even though there is a weak negative relationship between import dependency and self-sufficiency, those two variables by themselves do not give a real picture of the ability of the country to feed its population.

Given the complexity of the subject and drastic changes in international trade we could observe during the last three years, two case scenarios were developed: one which gave a rundown of the basic food availability parameters in a world as it is today, with (mostly) uninterupted international trade, and second which showcased a so called "Mad Max" scenario which is characterized by a complete stop of import and export of commodities. In this case, what the country produces is what it eats.

The end result were two Tableau visualizations:
  - [Food Availability Report](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/solanita/viz/FoodAvailabilityReport/FoodAvailabilityReport) in a form of a storyboard, and
  - an interactive dashboard [Can your country feed you?](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/solanita/viz/Canyourcountryfeedyou/Canyourcountryfeedyou) showcasing two mentioned scenarios.
### Data
Used data is open source data from FAOSTAT available [here](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS).
